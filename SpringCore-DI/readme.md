# Spring Core - Dependency Injection

This repository demonstrates the use of **Spring Core** for implementing **Dependency Injection (DI)**, a key concept in Spring Framework that promotes loose coupling and flexibility in your Java applications.

## Features

- Constructor-based Dependency Injection
- Setter-based Dependency Injection
- Field-based Dependency Injection
- Dependency Injection using annotations (`@Autowired`, `@Qualifier`, etc.)
- Configuration using XML and Java-based configurations
- Examples with various bean scopes (`singleton`, `prototype`)

## What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where the control of creating and managing objects is shifted from the application code to the Spring container. This helps in achieving **loose coupling** between components and improves testability.

In Spring, DI can be achieved in multiple ways:
1. **Constructor Injection**
2. **Setter Injection**
3. **Field Injection**

## Tech Stack

- **Java**: Programming language
- **Spring Core**: Framework
- **Maven**: Build tool

## Requirements

- Java 8 or later
- Maven 3.6 or later
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepakmali-09/springcore-di.git
